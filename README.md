# Live Project at Times Internet
# OVERVIEW
This project propels news classification to optimize advertising approaches and deepen user insights. It has two main goals: first, it gathers important details from news like people, groups, and themes to create precise audience groups and targeted ads. At the same time, it studies how users explore both our internal pages (TIL) and external pages to build complete user profiles that enhance ads. By combining news organization, audience targeting, and user understanding, it connects advertisers and users, resulting in tailored content and effective campaigns. This effort brings together advanced news organization, audience focus, and user insight, connecting advertisers and users by understanding news and behavior. The outcome is personalized content that stands out in the midst of data and leads to impactful campaigns that truly matter.


# Aman Rai (Project Contributor)
This particular branch, under the stewardship of Aman Rai, serves a pivotal role as a specialized workspace dedicated to the development of a sophisticated text classification model. Our focus is centered around the implementation of IAB categories, aiming to enhance our capabilities in accurately categorizing and analyzing textual content. Through this concerted effort, we aim to achieve a refined level of precision in text classification, contributing to our broader objectives.

# TECHNOLOGY STACK
The technology stack for this project encompass the following components and tools:
1.   ## Programming Language:
 - Python
2.   NLP Libraries:
